# Initiation to Rust Programming Language

Welcome to the Initiation to Rust workshop! The objective of this workshop is to introduce you to the Rust programming language by covering its fundamentals. After completing this workshop, you can explore more advanced topics by referring to the official Rust documentation, which is a high-quality resource for learning Rust: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html#the-rust-programming-language)

## Step 00
* Begin by installing Rust on your system by following the installation instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
